## Usage

Prepare an artboard and add shapes to it, making sure that some of them extend past the edges of the artboard.

Select the artboard and then choose the plugin `Tile` from the menu and you should see something like:

![Tiled Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumo/sketch-tiles/master/docs/tile-result.png)

It might require a bit of trial and error to ensure that shapes don't overlap
If you want to layout the template vertically or have more choice over the distance between the results, then should create two templates and select both of them before using the plugin.

### Notes
